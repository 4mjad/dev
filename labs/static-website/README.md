# A Simple Static Websites

Websites are written in a language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Real sites will have a mixture of other technologies too, but you can use plain HTML to produce a static website. That's a site with fixed content, where everyone who browses to it sees the same thing.

In this lab you'll see how to write some HTML code for a web page and open that page in your browser. You don't need any special tools installed for this.

## Write some code!

Open a text editor and create a new file:

- use Notepad on Windows
- or TextEdit on Mac - click _New Document_ and then in the menu bar click _Format...Make Plain Text_

Copy and paste this into it:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>paragraph</p>
</body>
```

> This is  HTML,  the language of websites. It's not a full programming language but it still has a strict syntax and it needs something to turn the code (the HTML) into the application (the website).

Save the file in your Documents folder and call it "index.html"

- if you're using Notepad, click _File_ then  _Save As_. In the window click the dropdown _Save as type_ and choose _All Files (*.*)_

- if you're using TextEdit it will ask you to confirm you want to use the extension _.html_ - you do :)


## Browse to the website

Find the file using Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder:

- open your Documents folder
- find the _index.html_ file
- right click and choose Open With 
- then select your web browser. 

You should see something like this:

## Lab

Developers don't just copy-and-paste code (although they do that a lot...) You can have really good knowledge of a language, and still need to research when you want to do something you haven't done before.

Give that a try - open your index.html file in the text editor again and make some changes:

- add some more text
- make it bold or italic
- add a link to https://dev.courselabs.co
- what happens if you make a syntax mistake?

Save any changes you make and refresh your browser to see how they look.

The reference section at the top will give you some ideas where to look.
