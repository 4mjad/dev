Open a text editor and create a new file:

- Notepad on Windows
- TextEdit on Mac - click _New Document_ and then in the menu bar click _Format...Make Plain Text_

Copy and paste this into it:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>paragraph</p>
</body>
```

> This is a language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It's the language of websites; it's not a full programming language but it still has a strict syntax and it needs something to turn the code (the HTML) into the application (the website).

Save the file in your Documents folder and call it "index.html"

- if you're using Notepad, click _File_ then  _Save As_. In the window click the dropdown _Save as type_ and choose _All Files (*.*)_

- if you're using TextEdit it will ask you to confirm you want to use the extension _.html_ - you do :)

Find the file using Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder, right click and choose Open With - then select your web browser. You should see something like this:

- TODO
