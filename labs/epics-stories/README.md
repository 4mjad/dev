Create board

- create a scrum board with sample data

- explore

- create a new epic 'Registration and login'

 how much information do you need?

 Now create a story under the epic:

 - this is for user login
 - you need more information here
 - use the standard as a...i want to...so that... format
 - make sure you assign it to your epic

 Open the story once it's created - there are more fields to set.

 When would the estimate get added?

 Browse from the story to the epic. From here you can easily add another story:

 - for registering a new user
 - you can enter just the summary from this screen
 - open the issue to add more detail
 - use the standard as a...i want to...so that... format

 Open the backlog view. Prioritize the new stories so they're at the top of the list.
