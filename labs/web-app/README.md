## Run the app

```
cd labs/web-app/src/

ls
```


```
npm install

node server.js
```

Lots of logs

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

> add & remove, refresh browser, check logs

Stop the app with Ctrl-C 

Refresh browser - what happens?

Start the app again, is the data still there?

## Lab

Change text "Welcome to the Event Calendar!". Do you need to stop and start the application again to see the changes?

Can you find where the data is actually stored? What happens if you delete the database file?
