npm install

node server.js
```

Lots of logs

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

> add & remove, refresh browser, check logs

Stop the app with Ctrl-C 

Refresh browser - what happens?

Start the app again, is the data still there?

## Lab

Change text "Welcome to the Bulletin Board"; do you need to rebuild with node to see the changes?

Can you find where the data is actually stored? What happens if you delete the database file?
