Done an advance of the planning meeting

Sprint goal is a loose description of the overall goal.

## Plan the work

- add estimates to stories
- typically "points" which is an approx measure of complexity
- usually 1, 3, 8 up to 40 
- can use tracking for time periods, e.g. 4h for a small task, 70h would be one dev full time for the sprint
- drag stories from backlog into sprint


## Start the sprint

- when the sprint is running you'll see stories in the active sprint view
- you can move status by dragging the stories
- how would this board relate to the daily standup?


## Lab

Why are points better than hours? What is a scrum team's velocity?
